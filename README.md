# Binary Search Tree (BST) Project

## Overview
A templated Binary Search Tree (BST) class with additional features such as parent pointers and node heights. The BST supports operations like insertion, deletion, finding successors, and right rotations.

## Features
- **Insertion**: Insert keys into the BST while maintaining the BST properties and updating node heights.
- **Deletion**: Remove keys from the BST and update node heights accordingly.
- **Successor**: Find the minimum key in the BST larger than a given key.
- **Right Rotation**: Perform a right rotation about a given node.
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of the BST operations.

## Files
- `bst.hpp`: Contains the definitions and implementations of the BST class member functions.
- `unit_tests.hpp`: Contains unit tests to verify the implementation.
- `bst.cpp`: A skeleton file for running tests (modifiable).

## Setup and Running the Tests
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BSTProject.git
   cd BSTProject
